"Personally, it was manageable doing in the same semester. I suppose these math mods are all about practice! The workload was manageable, just have to be consistent. And you do have SU to utilise if need be.",Joy,8,,,Joy,30,29.12621359,,1,15,10
"I thought it would be super difficult with many proof questions, so i practised to prove every theorem in the textbook and finished all exercise questions. Then it turned out that 70% of the paper(qn1-3) is all about computation, which is really difficult for me as i am careless and i didn't spend much time on practising calculating. So i spent most of my time working on qn1-3, which made me had insufficient time to finish qn4, but i still got qn2 and 3 wrong.",Sad,3,,,Sad,19,18.44660194,,2,15,10

"From what I know, it is very hard to fail, provided you put in some effort. 30% is probably a good estimate to get D (but of course, aim for higher, like 35%).

"is it just me or is this mod just insanely difficult? The prof literally just reads out all the definitions/theorems(and there are so many of them) and this chapter is finished. Uni math is already difficult and now with this prof who cannot teach AT ALL, kill me. It's nothing like A level math, and it's worse than linear algebra which I am also taking this sem. It's taking a toll on my mental wellness and now I just want to get a D and s/u, anyone has any idea how many % you need for a D?",Anger,1,,,Surprise,10,9.708737864,,5,15,10
I feel you. It's not just the definitions that's hard. It's that they give the equation in some weird form and were expected to big brain it into a form that can be integrated. Some of the steps are so out there I don't know how it's even possible to come up with it.,Anger,2,,,Fear,11,10.67961165,,6,15,10

"I dropped it this semester before recess week as I couldn't keep up and really cmi (poly background). The bellcurve though... I dk how is everyone getting close to full marks for every quiz unless they discussed with one another or just 200 IQ. The test 1 that I took before recess week, I only got like 35/50 and I was happy till I saw the bellcurve for test 1.... ridiculous and I am sure that ppl cheated for this test since the zoom recording only required us to show our faces....",Fear,4,,,,,,,,150,
"is a great mod I’ve taken in NUS. Profs introduce so much fascinating facts and trivia about the way Singapore is organised. If you hate writing, dont fret, writing has been reduced I guess. Forgot the profs’ names but their passion for Singapore is amazing. Superb mod I must say when I took it in 2018",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"read the readings, they are quite lengthy but very enjoyable. Tutorials are pretty chill. There’s a group project work during my time that required us to do fieldtrip about a significant place, the changes around the place etc. A fruitful one for me",Joy,8,,,,,,,Average Rating,5.5,
"assessments were all MCQ/MRQ using Examplify. Group project was to design a poster on mangrove species No tutorials, just 2 sessions of lectures per week which can be viewed on Luminus anytime, quite a chill mod imo I rmb it was quite popular on modreg",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"workload was ok, you just have to attend lectures, no tutorials. the mcq test had ~50 i think qns but open book, and tests only things before recess break. the profs were super nice as well, very approachable and helpful.",Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
"It’s pretty interesting content, and quite fun and manageable, so you can consider looking into it too, just that there are readings for you to draw examples during your midterms and finals",Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"I agree, the number of readings was pretty manageable, usually one compulsory reading at most. There are some recommended (i.e. optional) readings too. But be sure to read the compulsory ones carefully! Although the MCQ exams are pretty simple, some minor facts of hair-splitting specifics are only derived from the readings. The articles or essays assigned are usually rather easy, anyway, which is surprising for works that date back as far as the 1800s -- so you might as well read them :) I loved the module a lot and just took it in the last sem (AY20/21 Sem 1), so feel free to ask any questions here or in messages!",Neutral ,9,,,,,,,,,
"I've never felt so helpless in my life, and so stressed out, and on top of it all, alone. I am finding it harder and harder to focus on my work, things are really building up upon me, and I think mental health and confidence is taking a big hit.",Sad,1,,,,,,,,,

Even after spending more than 6 hours to a day constantly rewatching lectures and online YouTube tutorials, I still can’t do almost all of the tutorial questions? Now I’m constantly doubting whether I’m just dumb or not. At this rate, I’m sure I’m gonna flunk this mod super badly. I really need help and advise on this.",Fear,2,,,,,,,,,
"Assignment 2 was okay but prepare to do some self learning for assignment 1. From the result we got this sem prof seems to be quite lenient in his grading, but if your group cannot even finish it on time then it’s another story",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
I do not have any prior knowledge abt java but the prof is q good at teaching so I don’t feel it difficult to catch up,Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
"The introductory CS mods in NUS is one of the most useful class that you can take. Like many things in life, hard work pays off and you won't regret the result.",Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
There are actually quite a significant percentage of students who can get full marks or close to full marks for 2040 hence the steep bell curve. This is usually the case for more independent technical mods.,Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
"It’ll definitely be very helpful, especially for beginners to programming. It teaches you OOP which at most companies is the default way to write code, but it also teaches functional programming which is gaining popularity",Neutral ,6,,,,,,,,,
"Since you have prior experience, it won’t be that bad. I took it without any experience and struggled a lot with the weekly labs and the project. It is ultimately a very useful module but definitely one of the toughest modules I’ve taken so far. It’s kinda expected that the programming methodology modules will consume majority of your time if you don’t have programming experience, so the module isn’t for people who aren’t willing to devote a lot of time to it.",Sad,5,,,,,,,,,
"Took it last sem and for me, it was manageable, and I would say enjoyable even. You just have to be disciplined and start on the labs early, never underestimate the amount of time you need to finish the lab. Me and my friends started on every lab the day they were released and just spent the entire day doing it. My TAs were also quite helpful and would help nudge me in the right direction whenever I'm stuck. Once you get the lab over and done with, there's really nothing much else to do for the mod over the rest of the week. I didn't really have a problem with the teaching as well: it wasn't the best, the lectures were mostly reused from past years but given the covid situation, I think it is understandable.",Joy,6,,,,,,,,,
"Acc workload is pretty chill. 1 lecture & tutorial class per week plus a group project & final exam. Just remember to do your weekly self-study questions & revision, if not you may lag behind. All the best!",Joy,6,,,,,,,,,
dry and can be quite abstract. Assessments are writing based which can also be quite difficult for the ones who are not good at writing.,Sad,3,,,,,,,,,
"extremely chill and really interesting, Bell curve not that bad and exams were not too difficult",Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"not particularly interesting, but the knowledge gained from the module with regards to climate change is very useful.",Joy,6,,,,,,,,,
"super chill mod, 2MCs, if u are a CS student or know programming you’ll basically Smurf the mod. No bell curve cause class size is small. Basically 0 workload besides the assignments which can be completed in less than a day.",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"is known to be difficult, so don’t fret! I recommend that you go through the past year papers to get a sensing of what type of questions they like to ask. Also do note that the style of the questions may have slightly changed around 2 years ago as Prof Tan took over from Prof Ben as the lecturer around then, so it may be advisable to try the recent 2 papers first.",Surprise,7,,,,,,,,,
"What you described is what I faced 3 years ago - missions are manageable, papers are what-the-fuck. What the prof said back then was because have graduates come back and take 1010X to upskill, so he made it harder - which sort of didn't make sense to me cos don't the graduates have full-time jobs to worry about - so they have less time and energy to code?",Anger,4,,,,,,,,,
"To be honest, I felt that this sem CS3230 papers might have be relatively easier compared to the previous sems. Surprisingly not as hard to score as I had imagined it to be, especially with the technically free marks he gives out.",Surprise,9,,,,,,,,,
"i totally feel you! while some ppl are smart, i believe many others get past ans from seniors or friends which is why they can answer so damn fast!!! i hope your prof is kind and gives low CP ppl a chance tho :,) also, only certain topics r tested for finals and the structures is kinda the same over the years so focus on the right stuff for that and you're good to go!! and SU wisely hehehe",Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"Class part felt ok, I spoke up once every class or so. This is relatively easy as there are many class part opportunities in lecture, mini project and final project presentations. The content of this mod is very manageable, but this mod requires you to be hardworking. To do well, you need to put in effort to do well in all the components which can be time consuming.",Neutral ,7,,,,,,,,,
"The prof really is one of the best few I had in my 3 semester in NUS! Compared to the later AH mods, the lecture readings pretty chill tbh because you don’t necessarily have to read as the slides are suffice for the test (30%). The test only cover 3 lectures contents so there’s not much to memorize and the prof will highlight which artworks to study and you just have to read the tutorial readings (very minimal, 10 to 20 pgs long) and keep talking in class to get the free 40% grade",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"I have troubles with being able to meet the basic level drawings because I’m really not proficient in that. But this issue is more about being able to produce your ideas and make them into drawings. I’m just having issue with translating ideas into drawing. For the workload of Design 1, this really needs you to be able to put a lot of time and effort into the assignments. For us Architecture students, our whole life in school just revolves around that one module. The rest of the modules get kinda pushed to the side because of how much time and effort is put into the design module. This really depends on how much you enjoy the module. If you can’t cope with the stress, it won’t work out for you",Fear,3,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting module :) Didn't spend too much on it due to overloading but did pretty decent (B+). I think it's not too hard to do well if you generally can write decently. I remembered I could choose anything I wanted to write for the final essay, as long as its related to American history. I learnt quite a bit abt US history, but didnt really keep up a lot with the lectures and readings",Surprise,7,,,,,,,,,

"Please, please try to avoid him as much as possible, because He is very confusing in teaching, giving projects, and setting exam papers. The project is to find any dataset, form any hypothesis, and no grading rubrics given at all. You will be very confused along the way regardless of your grasp of concepts taught, because you do not know what professor wants. Even if you feel that you have a strong foundation in linear regression and statistics (i.e.: you can self-learn everything and grasp the concepts well), his exam paper is going to make you so confused that you do not even know what he is trying to ask. Awkward and misleading phrasing are going to be everywhere in the exam papers and slides. Can't imagine how the grading will be like as I can imagine our answers are going to be all over the place. sigh",Anger,1,,,,,,,,,
"depends on how good you are in stats - id say the workload is relatively okay if you took stats before but you might need to spend more time on it if you haven't done stats before. also just watch out for the finals, can be pretty intense but pray for bell curve HAHA",Neutral ,4,,,,,,,,,

"Personally I dropped the module mid-sem since I already had my own resume/was busy with other modules.People might say that it’s a free 2 MCs but I would rather spend the time/effort on modules that actually matter, because 1002 does have deliverables as well. No matter how simple the deliverables, it’s an additional “burden” you need to handle, needing to remember deadlines, watch the videos, clearing of quizzes etc etc.Take the module if you really want the “expert” guidance on resume crafting, cover letter writing etc. But then again, Google’s the best teacher for these kinda things.",Surprise,4,,,,,,,,,
"i think it was quite enjoyable but i’m just not a movie person so it was a bit sian to watch 10 movies for a module 🥺 but compared to the other asian studies mod, ch1101e workload q chill bc no readings HAHA pm me if u wanna ask about grades",Surprise,6,,,,,,,,,
"I think it’s quite interesting. Tutorials are on odd/even weeks and i find it quite intriguing to discuss with others and hear opinions about the characters from movies watched. We had to do a presentation and a paper on the movie we were assigned to and every week you have to watch movies in order to take part in class discussion (15%). Overall workload was decent, especially if you have group mates that are efficient. He made lectures interesting and he’s quite a funny prof. I would rate it a 9/10.",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"probably the hardest cuz you dont really have ""free"" assignments or projects to buffer your score. so how well you do in the midterm quizzes/finals directly affects your final grade. it's also the most tedious and content heavy 3k mod although it's really useful in understanding separation processes and sets the groundwork",Fear,4,,,,,,,,,
The exam was last Wednesday but can I just ask what the hell was going on???? Am I the only one who didn’t know what in the world was going on for the last few questions. The two chem exams this sem were just train wrecks...,Anger,3,,,,,,,,,
"Its generally a doable module with only theory and exams. There's no lab. Personally for me, it was difficult at the start bc I was still getting used to school. As a result I did pretty badly for midterms. But when the second half of the semester came it became a lot easier. Also I feel the content in the 2nd half of the semester is better (and more interesting). I had Prof Sarada and I think she's really good. Very willing to help you out 1-to-1 consult. In terms of workload, it's not too bad: weekly tutorials that are relatively doable.",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
is fun cos it had weekly labs which makes it easy to make friends. The experiments are fun and v enjoyable.,Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"It'll mostly be people who won't need to use programming for their major, so the concepts taught aren't difficult. Labs mostly just copy paste code from lecture.",Surprise,5,,,,,,,,,
"someone who really sucks at coding even feels really hard for me especially since the first take home assignment will be released this weekend and i’m feeling very stressed over it 😭😭 am i the only one who feels that they didn’t really teach much coding in the lab lecture videos and the concepts in lectures are quite hard to grasp as well, i do feel like i’m struggling quite a bit in the mod, really just trying my best to at least complete the weekly lab notebooks, quizzes and project and hopefully won’t have to remod even if i do badly for the take home assignments 😭😭",Sad,2,,,,,,,,,
"The assignments are just downright hell for me, it has come to a point where I completely don't know what is going on, because rather than actually making u learn, the assignments are made to ""prove your worth"". Favouring those who has had past experiences coding. Of course I have no choice but to rely on my assignments given my shitty single digit mid term results and going to be bad PE results, and even then I don't know whether I can pass this module. I am so done being burnt out, I have been crying since friday morning and I couldn't sleep Friday night because I don't know what to do anymore, I hate all my modules and I especially hate CS1010. The whole approach of it being beginner friendly whilst throwing these kind of assignment questions is just inhumane to me, who has had no coding experience before.",Sad,1,,,,,,,,,
"that's bullshit, why should I indulge myself in something which is making my mental health so bad to the extent when I wake up I'm unhappy I'm alive? If I fail this mod, I don't know what I am gonna do. I really don't. I'm sick of the assignments, the tests, the way the prof teaches the topics, everything. I hate this and I hate my life.",Anger,1,,,,,,,,,
"say i bombed it pretty badly. i studied so hard over recess week for this 10% midterms and did past year papers only to get rekt so badly? i don't even know what i'm doing wrong. when i saw the average, i was already preparing myself but i did not prepare to fail THIS badly. fr, i'm done with this mod. The weekly assignments, heavy workload and exams. i'm sick and tired of the secrecy and the reluctance of giving answers and explanations for mock midterms (and everything else). the only resources are the notes, a QnA forum which is IMHO not very helpful, and google. The mentality of 'breaking us down to build us up' is just draining. there is not one day i don't go without thinking about this mod. i'm burnt out from this one mod and i don't want to repeat it but i don't know what to do from here. i have no idea how to bounce back and pass this mod. i have nvr felt this stupid. the way it is taught is so dry and uninteresting",Sad,1,,,,,,,,,
"bruh i’m just lost. like my prof is good and seems really open to consultation but i just cannot deal with this module 🤡 i’m so so confused in every single class and i don’t even know what i don’t know so how to consult. ur feelings are justified bc this mod was truly death for me. For some background, I'm hopeless in math/data stuff lol, and DAO is all abt that so u can imagine.... i am way too far behind and i really can’t catch up at all😭 i have zero clue what’s gg on so i’m just doing my best for the project and assignments and i’m just gna hope i can s/u this :’)",Sad,2,,,,,,,,,
"In fairness, I’m fairly confident that I did well in other grade components like group projects, tutorials, assignments, class part, etc. For my finals revision, I really did try my hardest but it all came crashing down due to the pressure of the exam environment and format... I’ve just been so depressed about it, I feel like my efforts have just gone to waste...",Sad,2,,,,,,,,,
"I made the unfortunate choice of taking this module in AY21/22 Semester 1 and it's no doubt the worst module I've taken. As a final year student at NUS, I've never had a professor who is not only too lazy to conduct her module properly, but also seem to have a personal vendetta against her student. This is going to be a rather lengthy post detailing her method of conducting the module and her attitude towards me but She was unnecessarily rude when I pointed out a typo on the slides. She doesn't bother planning the assignments she gives in advance. She gives 0 for submission if you name your file wrongly. She was too lazy to use LumiNUS properly. The most absurd of all: she accused me of lying",Anger,1,,,,,,,,,
"Took the same mod this sem, actually found her to be ok despite some questionable actions here and there eg. not providing answers for sample exam paper as she was ‘too busy’, being super vague about the final exam format and being super anal about the file naming etc.. personally still felt that her teaching was good with lots of class part, case studies and even a game (that lasted 2 weeks, which meant 2 weeks less content for finals yay) Finals were doable too, gave her a decent score for the prof review and got a decent grade in the end too",Surprise,3,,,,,,,,,
Hey me too! My experience was around the same as yours. Was actually quite shocked to find this out. I thoroughly enjoyed the seminars with her and when I clarified things with her she is very nice and explained things well. Yeah the sample exam one was quite fishy but tbh she could have just said she did not want to release answers for privacy issue etc. & I would understand. The file naming one was quite scary but luckily my eye never cock up and everything was quite smooth.,Surprise,4,,,,,,,,,
"is a free 4MC mod where you SHOULD really get A/A+ easily (although it has a lot of math and I'm more inclined towards it, so take this with a bit of salt).

My biggest L in university so far is not taking GEQ when I could. Instead I’m suffering with this absolutely useless mod. The amount of effort needed is insane. Imagine spending CNY doing some retarded creative exercise lmao,Anger,2,,,,,,,,,
"Taking this mod this sem where they said they 'significantly reduced the workload' as compared to last sem. If this is the reduced workload, I cannot fathom the amount of pain and misery the people who took this last sem went through. Took it last sem. Neaely cried my eyes out doing the stupid projects. I wanted to pull my hair out while doing this over CNY. Then I realized that I have SUs left to spare. So I deleted the homework file, closed my laptop and waltzed out of my house feeling like a champ.",Sad,1,,,,,,,,,
I thought the point of intro mods was to ease students into learning the curriculum and also to bridge the guys who spent 2 years serving the nation back into studying… then out of the blue the midterms sudd had this crazy time limit. Or am I just dumb idk man,Surprise,3,,,,,,,,,
"beware of steep bell curve (it's pure MCQ so you probably need full marks from midterms and do extremely well for finals to get an A+) and no I wouldn't think its sufficient to just focus during lectures to get A+ because readings are tested and there's usually QUITE A FEW EVERY WEEK. Some are pretty factual and easier to remember imo e.g. the newspaper articles in the problem sets, while some are just full of fluff e.g. those she takes from the book (Sorry Dr Ong). During closed-book exams nitty gritty stuff such as ""In xxx reading, which policies were used effectively to tackle xxx problem?"" and all the options were actually covered in the reading, you need to recall which specific ones were actually effective. And also the application of concepts can get tricky, expect some weird questions you've never seen before in exams e.g. 3 strategy game theory question etc. So yeah while I think that content is pretty manageable (if you took Econs in JC there's quite a bit of overlap), it's hard to get a really good grade because of some tricky questions which are meant to differentiate the bell curve.",Neutral ,4,,,,,,,,,
"The workload isn't that bad and still manageable, in my opinion. There are just readings for each week's class that you have to do in order to be able to do the reading quizzes in class; then there are just two midterms and a final exam/take-home final CA.",Neutral ,6,,,,,,,,,
"it's a module on basic syntax. if you found el1101e under dr leslie lee a breeze and an easy A, you'll most likely find (which is also under dr leslie lee) almost as easy, based on my own personal experience.

I’ll highly recommend it! The mod was taught by Prof Starr when I took it and her explanations were extremely clear and simple so it was very easily understandable for someone like me who doesn’t have any background. Mine were mainly pre-recorded lectures and the assignments/exams were open-book application questions fo test your understanding of the content.

"this was one of the easiest mods to get A for, I decided to put in my effort to try and at least get a good grade for it. This turned out to be true though because I did manage to get an A- in the end. The mod is very structured and doesn’t have a steep bellcurve from what I know (because most people just aim to SU it). All you have to do is consistently do your assignments using what the tutors taught (they’ll give marks accordingly), and you should be able to score well easily (Just don’t sleep in class haha). Luckily I had a fun tutor last sem which really made the sessions pretty fun and lively so do try your best to participate in class because it does get boring listening sometimes, usually I just cracked random jokes in class though ahaha. Overall, I think the content they teach is actually quite useful and it trains you on how to write/structure your academic essays. I’m taking 3K FASS mods now and I really think this mod helped me to structure my essay/sentences more logically haha. So dont feel discouraged about it and use this as a learning opportunity! :) feel free to pm me if u have more questions haha",,10,,,,,,,,,
"can fulfill UEM requirement and it is very helpful in learning academic writing techniques. It is quite an eye opener. I took it few weeks back during special term I. Learn how to use apa style in text end text citation, sources, hyper themes, macro themes, how to write a argumentative essay, introduction, body, conclusion etc, how to link one paragraph to another, toolkits to write better academic writings and alot more useful you will learn along the way. I will say it is indeed helpful =)",,9,,,,,,,,,
"can be challenging if you have no Python knowledge, especially for the exams and group project, but since it's bell curved and most of the cohort don't know much about programming you can probably pass",,5,,,,,,,,,
"many business students struggle with this mod, so it is very common to see people freeloading for the projects and weekly assignments. Thus, if you are the only one that is capable of doing the projects and assignments, you will end up doing them by yourself.",,2,,,,,,,,,
Research proposal imo is one of the most important assignments for this mod becos its going to be kind of a guide/template for your final essay. Do find a topic that interests you becos something that gives u interest is likely going to encourage u to research deeper. Try going for consultations. The tutors do give it if requested and their advice on how to write the essay is going to be much more customised as compared to the syllabus stuff.,,5,,,,,,,,,
is a really nice module to take but the workload requires you to be a bit consistent. The prof doesn't believe in force memorisation (so there's no finals) but there is some reflection to be written every week but it was one of the most meaningful modules I ever took + is a gem,,9,,,,,,,,,
"This mod is light, kinda low commitment and not hard if you put some effort. I taken all 5 GE pillars and I can say this mod is the best in terms of workload besides the GEQ which is SU-able. Btw I scored quite well so I’m glad to chose this mod :) Btw the profs are engaging though hard to understand with a bit of Chinese accent. However you will be able to survive and score with the slides and the reading.",,9,,,,,,,,,
"He is very passionate, and probably the kindest and nicest professor I’ve ever met. He will always try to brighten up your day, and you can really feel how much love he has for what he teaches. He is always willing to help you when you approach him. Despite the long list above, the workload is pretty light. There are no tests or essays. Don’t worry too much about remembering all the details taught in lecture as you can always refer back to your notes. For team project, there are 2 presentations and one e-book. These will take up most of your time, but can be done fairly quickly. They don’t require too much time and energy either. For the individual work, the weekly reflective learning assignment will take up most of your time, but if you diligently do them every week, you won’t feel them at all. The reviews and quizzes are done either during lecture or after, and are open book (for quizzes). In fact, Prof Lam encourages you to do the quizzes while checking your notes.",,10,,,,,,,,,
"The workload for this module is pretty light, and lectures are mostly there to brush up on your general knowledge regarding biodiversity. Dr. Ng and Dr. Choong both deliver content verbally, while their slides often consist only of one image along with a title/caption. There is no webcast, so listening is key, as whatever the lecturers say could come out on the test/exam. There are also no tutorials, instead being replaced by more lectures.",,8,,,,,,,,,
"Relatively chill mod and MCQ finals and midterms. 1 grp project that requires you and your group to go for a walk in one of the nature parks in SG(depends on what question you get). I did this mod last sem so it was an open book open universe exam. The power of Google probably hard carried my ass for this mod. I put in some effort but never had intense studying sessions for it, because well, it is an open universe exam. Got an A for this mod.",,10,,,,,,,,,
"Takes the top place as my favourite mod in NUS. Prof Stella is stellar at teaching this module, not to mention that the contents are super interesting. If you have watched police/detective/law dramas I highly recommend this mod. There is a test every 2 to 3 weeks at the end of the lectures but it is relatively easy as long as you follow through the lecture. Downside is that it is a 7 to 9 plus lecture (the slot is 6 to 10) and not webcasted. I got pretty high for all the tests but screwed up my midterms, which was a one page report. Got a B+ in the end but I really liked the mod.",,10,,,,,,,,,
"quite nice. One tutorial every 2 weeks (make sure to contribute a bit to class discussion). You don’t need to attend a single lecture to contribute to the class, the tutor usually asks about personal experiences. One group essay (I think around 1200 words per person) and a book review. Everyone I know got an A or A-.",,9,,,,,,,,,
"the prof was super passionate which makes it really fun! Workload was pretty light imo too, didn't have to do much studying, just referred to notes when necessary and got an A+ in the end (many people I know scored well in the mod)",,9,,,,,,,,,
"It was quite slack, just sharing answers to tutorial questions given beforehand. The class participation portion is quite competitive however. I found it a bit of a waste of time tbh. The workload was just one news report and one essay. The news report was analysing a news article and applying what whatever learnt to explain the article. For the essay, the Prof gave 5 very broad themes and we could write anything within the theme. The only complaint I have was that the essay was pretty time-consumung cus the word limit was 3.5k. So yeah overall it was quite a slack mod haha, the content and readings are v manageable as well!",,8,,,,,,,,,
"This module is designed in a way that allows students to focus on themes of their preference to do their assignments. So if you are self-disciplined and keen on delving deep into some particular topics introduced in each lecture, you are good to go. Would say it's pretty chill, I didn't do any of the readings except for those I'm writing for class responses. Tutorial also don't require much preparation and lecture is pretty engaging - Dr Carl is not too bad of a lecturer if you're interested in politics!",,7,,,,,,,,,
Content was somewhat interesting but I stopped watching after the first week. Went into the exams somewhat blind and just Googled on the spot since it was open-internet too. Good module to take in Y1 to SU. Honestly quite interesting and the professor Dr John van Wyhe was extremely passionate and knowledgeable,,9,,,,,,,,,
coz 100% continual assessment and no final exam (syllabus changes from time to time so no guarantees its the same everytime). Actually the mod was quite easy to score in my opinion coz the weekly quizzes (20%) were legit Control + F from the readings. And the final essay you could write anything you want as long as its related to Asia and History. Honestly would recommend this mod.,,8,,,,,,,,,
"has quite a bit of jargon and specific definitions for certain terms. these are quite important for tests but are not too difficult because the prof does provide a glossary and a lot of guidance. there are also essay components about global issues which can naturally be analyzed in multiple perspectives, so if you are good at writing it will be easy to do well there. i took it because it sounded interesting and overlaps with soci quite a bit; the prof who teaches it is from the soci dept. if that appeals to you then i would recommend it.",,5,,,,,,,,,
"is fun if you want to try out acting, but the workload is quite heavy, especially the theory portion but the professors are all very experienced.",,5,,,,,,,,,
is really an easy module. Just have to watch movies and proactively participate in the tutorial. Exam questions are straightforward too.,,7,,,,,,,,,
"The module was interesting! You will be attached to a mentor whom will guide your group through the process of writing the research paper. It’s a unique experience and it will give you an insight of how the curriculum is like in dukenus. You might struggle a little with the concepts but right from the start of the module, we had some ice breakers as a class and set some ground rules within our groups that we always ask if unsure, and always help if you are able to clarify the doubt :)",,7,,,,,,,,,
"it’s a p chill mod. No math, no coding, no tut haha. It’s graded on quizzes and grp proj. Good mod to take If u wan overload :)",,9,,,,,,,,,
"Most (~70%) of the quiz questions are fluff, where you can ctrl+f the textbook for the answer. It got worse/better (depends on each person) in the second half of the semester where he straight up gave free marks for choosing yes at least once per week, sometimes even twice. Some of them are tricky though, felt like he was testing observation skills instead as he would just change a word to see if you realise it. Bellcurve is kinda steep. Personally I got an A with 91 while someone on nusmods got a B+ with 87.",,4,,,,,,,,,
"I am terribly worried about getting an F again. The thought of getting an F again is haunting me almost everyday... Can't believe i cant even handle a 1k mod. All the posts about people struggling badly this sem too makes me just wanna cry not knowing whats waiting for me next sem. I know i sound like a loser but I just suck at coding. I don't think anyone would have taken the same mod 3 times but I dont wanna be the first one to do that. My cap rn is about 3.6 which is not good either. I want to do better next sem, Im planning to start studying for CS1010E right after this sem's finals are over. But I feel like CS is really a skill that is just not for everyone 😢😢 I really don't want to get an F one more time for the exact same mod, it will crush my self-esteem by a lot... I'm sure there will be people replying to this saying i'm just whining and im such a loser...",,1,,,,,,,,,
"pretty chill mod, mcq for midterm and final, no projects, tutorials whatsoever, just listen to the lectures carefully and read the weekly readings (not a lot) can liao. And the prof is absolutely great at teaching and engaging students",,10,,,,,,,,,
"best mod I have taken, extremely chill and really interesting, u get to learn stuff like how being born in earlier months is considered luckier and whether we actually have free will. Bell curve not that bad and exams were not too difficult.",,10,,,,,,,,,
"introduces you to a whole new side of mathematics that you probably have never seen before up till now, and it will give you a brief glimpse of whether you will be enjoying mathematics in university. Both are great professors whom I have taken modules under.",,8,,,,,,,,,
"Tbh cs1231 was a little disappointing and a lot less rigorous than what my friends were doing in ma1100; exam questions were more about ""how fast can you think of a solution to this"" rather than in-depth proofs. My final exam had like only 20 marks proof-based out of 100. Neither has much of a workload other than understanding the content tbh",,4,,,,,,,,,
has been the best mod I've taken. The prof is actually really great and I sometimes look forward to the pre recorded lectures. It has been more enjoyable than I expected. The assessment also seems pretty fair and isn't bogged down by convoluted proctoring procedures like most mods.,,10,,,,,,,,,
"im not a v outspoken person so presentations being online this sem were rly helpful since i didnt feel as pressurised or anxious + my group prepared a script beforehand so we basically js read of our scripts HAHA tbh i feel that how well you do is also dependent on the topic you get for the presentation. i got housing, family & education which was imo easier to present compared to law per se. all the topics are v interesting nonetheless! i rly didnt say much during tutorials which was horrible on my part but meisen does a rly good job at providing us with different perspectives of things & also knowing when to chime in while still giving us ample room to speak!!",,10,,,,,,,,,
"Those were some of the best mods i have ever taken, fun and interactive. Lecturer and Tutors were all encouraging and supportive. Jumping is fairly easy - just need to go for a short chat with the teacher(s). They will try to place you in the right class as long as you honestly represent your abilities during the chat. As far as grades go, i think its difficult to get anything A- and above (unless you really devote your effort to mastering the language, but chances are you have your core modules to worry about). There are occasionally smurfs (people who are already good at the language but pretend they are not) which can make the bell curve kinda difficult, but as long as you do your due diligence, you should not do too badly :D",,9,,,,,,,,,
"it defers from person to person. I got median grades for and i’d spend about 2-4 hours on it everyday if i averaged everything out. Which is ridiculous but i had close to no experience in programming beforehand, so i had to put in the hours. Keep in mind that a good part of  is problem solving (akin to puzzles), so you can go into a mission and finish it in 1 hour (the proudest moment of my life) or spend close to 3 hours for the next 3 days doing it (this was my worst, it was a mission to do with music and sound) It just depends on if you see the solution or not. I’d say i’m the average CS kid in NUS, so as long as you put in the hours and grasp concepts well, you will get Bs no problem. But if you want As, get ready to put in double the work :P (i decided it was not worth it, especially since just one exam can easily cost you your A)",,5,,,,,,,,,
"MCs wise, a normal mod is about 4 MCs. The higher the MC for a mod, the more workload said mod has. So when I say 8 MC, i mean to treat as 2 mods worth of workload. But you have to try it to understand it. This is one of those things that depends on your load management and your focus.",,4,,,,,,,,,
content sounds really interesting but the 8am lectures really ain't it and I didn't really get the point of the 45 min pre-lecture engagement honestly... Some of the lectures were really interesting tho I liked the AI one. The quiz can discuss/check Tele so not that hard to score well and honestly the grading system for this mod is q lenient as it's 50% quiz 50% class part/presentation so there's no essays or finals,,6,,,,,,,,,
content was rlly interesting (except Gilgamesh) and profs were really engaging/entertaining. The quiz is q confusing sometimes but can discuss/check Tele so not that hard to score well (or at least average). The final take home assignment was also q fun as it grades how well u understand and apply the concepts to Ur everyday life,,7,,,,,,,,,
"content was ok for me as a science student (although the scientific content might put off those from the arts). It's mainly on climate change which is q interesting given the recent impacts and awareness on climate change(extreme weather events, SG2030 etc) block tests were q challenging imo esp since there's no time to discuss but workshops and exploratariums were q fun.",,6,,,,,,,,,
"content was fairly interesting, but it felt like they were milking ideas out of u as u have to think of 10 ideas for this then 10 ideas to improve etc. Tutorials were q fun although the time given for the tut activities were q less. Also the grading for the segments are kinda iffy as it feels like writing more = scoring better, even if the ideas I wrote made no sense or were beating around the bush. I gave up at the prototype section...",,4,,,,,,,,,
"I have to say... I don't think this is really true personally? I got 2/4 EEs so far (other 2 MEs) and I didn't feel like I had to put in an absurd amount of effort for it. I didn't even talk to anybody about the mod outside of working in groups in tutorials. The ILAs are designed for MAX 3h-4 of work every 2 weeks and the tutorials are really just fill in the blank. Everything here is made as easy as possible for what they want to teach. Also, they're literally just holding our hands through this. They keep describing in almost painful detail the framework and approaches to design thinking and shit. You don't need experience in design to be able to understand what they're saying. The benefit of being a common mod is that the majority of people don't know what's going on either. You're not at a disadvantage for not having prior experience. I'll be honest I don't know how they grade things, but I think it's fair to assume (from what I've done) that if you just vomit out something that sounds smart it'll be better than just putting something average and generic. The reflection questions sound like CCE classes or whatever student leadership things in sec sch/jc where they try to make you explain why something was good. I'm not complaining because it's pretty low effort.",,7,,,,,,,,,
"was a fun mod, prof GG is a great teacher that had to make do with the lack of response in zoom lectures, overall content is interesting and makes u think abt the role of luck in life. Readings are average for a GE/arts mod, exams are based on core concepts found in the readings. Not particularly difficult unless one is trying for A, which requires a deeper understanding of how the concepts were applied and which are used in which context. Would recommend regardless as a GE/UE",,6,,,,,,,,,
"Structure is very very light, one recorded lecture, notes, and reading per week. 10 quizzes of mcq ONLY. Tutorial (1hr) requires little prep besides the lecture. 20% easy class part if u just try. The quizzes are rather simple. Make sure to discuss w/ peers and if you have a strong command of english you're good to go. On average I barely spend any time on this mod because lectures can be watched at 2x speed. If you're planning on taking logic and philo i assume you should be strong enough to understand both modules concepts covered.",,9,,,,,,,,,
"i did not watch any lecture videos, skipped a tutorial session (worth 6%), on average got ~3 out of 6% for the 6 quizzes as i did them blindly and still passed the mod. Not sure what’s the grading like for this semester but if it’s the same as before, make sure you at least try in the forum posts and participate in the tutorials. The tutors don’t want to fail you anyway, so the bare minimum is enough.",,5,,,,,,,,,
"It’s not a hard mod, but the assessment requirements are rlly bleh and not explained vv well. As an example you have to design a poster abt a public health problem, and it’s group work. You can’t choose your group mates so it’s a lottery, and if you’re not artistically talented or have a group mate that is you’re gonna struggle to do better than average for this. It’s an interesting mod for sure, and workload is indeed manageable if you’re looking for a mod to SU, but it rlly is not easy to do well in it :/",,4,,,,,,,,,
"is well liked cause the prof is great, and the midterms/finals are MCQ. If you’re okay with lots of readings, and you like the topic, you’ll love this mod. That being said, MCQ assessments means the bell curve can be tough, but it’s def easier (imo) to do well in this mod",,8,,,,,,,,,
"It was fun but like someone else said, language mods tend to have competitive bellcurves. this is especially tougher if your classmates alr have some form of fluency in the language beforehand (there are a number of them in every language mod). also, the jump of difficulty from level 1 to level 2 and each subsequent level tbh, at least for me and some of my classmates, was quite a leap so that took consistent adjusting every sem and keeping myself in check. imo, my language mods were the mods i had to make sure i put consistent weekly effort in compared to other normal mods where i could afford to maybe miss one reading and catch up another time!! overall, i definitely performed much better CAP wise in my GEMs, but still don’t regret taking malay bcos it made me grow an appreciation and interest in it",,5,,,,,,,,,
I can easily say that it is the most useful or fun mod I’ve taken in NUS (biz student here doing double maj in BZA). The rumors u heard are prob true. It is extremely tough and the workload is insane.. the amount of missions and side quests (term for assignments) to complete will be a culture shock to most people. However it is like bitter medicine. Consistency is key and this mod requires a lot of hard work!! I would encourage anybody looking for a useful UE to clear to go for it. The prof and tutors are also extremely helpful.,,8,,,,,,,,,
"Probably the most fun mod I've taken in NUS so far. Did this pre-covid, so really not sure how the module is conducted under e-learning formats. Lectures are interesting you get to learn how different people and groups develop their music and culture. Tutorials are weekly sessions where you get to learn and play music from different cultures and countries. (Sundanese, Balinese gamelan, south Indian music, African music) The tutorials are extremely fun and chill with no prep work needed. I strongly recommend taking pictures and videos of your playing and the instruments. Workload is really really light, consisting of weekly journal updates on tutorial sessions, 2 concert reports (1 for each half sem) and a group presentation on local music etc.",,10,,,,,,,,,
"It was really a really fun mod going through the different topics in philosophy and uses a lot of logical reasoning. Workload wise it was pretty manageable, just got to finish a weekly MCQ quiz and there is an MCQ exam. Despite being mcq it can be kinda tricky because the small nuances in the phrasing really affects the answer, but still quite doable. I am from SoC but I wouldn't say i felt disadvantaged taking the mod. In fact, taking a mod that touched on some logic (CS1231) certainly helped me grasp some of the arguments faster.",,9,,,,,,,,,
