I'm looking to s/u and just clear this CS mod. Currently I'm struggling to complete the weekly tutorial coding questions, as you must get an A grade to get the full percentage. The things they teach during lectures is so far removed from the actual practical questions in terms of difficulty. It's honestly quite ridiculous with regard to the learning curve of cs1010.

Plus, the time lag of understanding the concepts and being thrown the assignments, is huge. It takes me a long time to understand the concepts taught in lectures because I have to Google, YouTube etc, and before that, I am thrown an assignment with a tight deadline and have to find any possible way to submit a functioning code. So much so that I don't have time allocated to fully digesting each concept. Of course what I say now isn't going to change anything, but I'm pretty sure I am echoing the unheard voices of many of my friends who share the same thoughts and feelings as me. Yes, this module is difficult, and I admit that, but it definitely isn't inclusive to the varying types of learners that students are.\",\n",
       " 'Even if you do fail, just SU and retake next sem. Your CAP won‚Äôt be affected. I also failed CS1010 in my first sem but got A when I took it again the following sem. think of it as giving yourself more time to strengthen your fundamentals.',\n",

If you find urself struggling and lacking, attempt all the problem sets. You made the point of favouring people with experience but people like them were either a natural talent or once like you who did not understand and slowly learnt. Take a breather and slowly learn to solve each problem. Memorising codes and solution will never help you anywhere, do avoid that path. You can always solve the problem with your friends and share how you guys do it. Nobody will have the same code and you guys might have a different approach which might be beneficial. If you‚Äôre a computing major, you might want to start putting more effort because mods after this will be significantly harder and it takes hard work and passion to keep it going.
